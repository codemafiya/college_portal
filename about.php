			From outside, RayTech’s story may seem as one of those much talked about dorm room startups that has shown promise and rapidly growing. While most of that is true, RayTech’s story has been about perseverance and focus towards one goal - making comptitive exam simple and efficient. And this journey has been no walk in the park - we have had our share of challenges and we know there are more to come in the future. 

But RayTech’s real story is that of the people who run it. From the two college friends who willed an idea to reality, to the people who put their faith into the aim of the startup and took it as their own, HackerEarth is many stories, of the people who make it. Our story is continually changing, as the people at RayTech keep writing new ones, everyday.</p>
